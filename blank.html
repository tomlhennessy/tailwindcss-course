                        <p>Algebra was really hard for me, and I was falling behind. But my tutor goes over
                            everything slowly and doesn&apos;t make me feel dumb for asking questions. Now I
                            actually understand what&apos;s going on in class, and my grades are getting better too.

                        <p>I needed help with maths because I don&apos;t like my teachers but I didn&apos;t want to
                            fail my final year exams. James really knew how to explain things in a way that I could
                            understand and I ended up doing better than expected :D</p>

                        <p>I wanted to find a tutor who could help advance my daughters mathematics ability beyond
                            her current age level and stimulate her with more challenging material. James did an
                            excellent job of helping Olivia to build her enthusiam and ability in Maths.</p>

                        <p>I felt that school was starting to get more challenging and I was unable to pass all my
                            exams without some extra assistance. My sessions with Bridget were very supportive and
                            enjoyable and it helped make completing all my homework and studying super easy.</p>
